Estimation, hypothesis testing, and model assessment for 2 group and k group studies. Experimental design and the use of pairing/blocking. Analysis of discrete data. Correlation and regression, prediction, model selection and diagnostics. Simple mixed models including nested random effects and split plot experimental designs. Use of the SAS statistical software.</p>
                <p><strong>STAT 510. Statistical Methods II.</strong> Model selection and collinearity in linear regression. Likelihood analysis for general models and models with non-normal random components; linear model results in the context of likelihood; linear mixed models and their application; estimation, inference, and prediction.
